An outing to the farm was the highlight of the day. It was brilliant - a real working farm, not commercialised for visitors. The farmer took us on a few rides to go pond dipping, bug hunting, den building as well as meeting all the animals. During this he recounted how as a step farmer he could relate to Jesus being the shepherd as well as his favourite Bible stories. A few songs and a short film to round off the day. We managed to squeeze in 11 (yes 11) renditions of "Happy Birthday" to one of our guests too!
